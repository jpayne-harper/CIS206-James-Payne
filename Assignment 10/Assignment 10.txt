"In this session you willl learn about regular expressions. These types of expression will allow you to manipulate text. It can be used to process files that are unstructured and thuis you must search for items in the file. 
It can also be used for applications such as find and replace. 
You must import the library in order to use such commands and objects. The library is the re. 
In this session you will read about regular expressions, the types of objects and methods available and about the types of problems you can solve using regular expressions. 
You can skim the Wikiversity links. However, the Youtube videos are very well done. 
Once you become familiar with regular expression syntax, write a program to solve the problems in the assignment document. 
You may put all the solutions in a single program file if you so choose. 
Upload the file(s) to your repository. Paste the link of your repository into Blackboard when completed. "

1. Complete one or more of the following tutorials:
RegexOne: Learn Regular Expressions
Regular-Expressions: Tutorial
Ryan's Tutorials: Regular Expressions Tutorial
RexEgg: Regex Tutorial
Review Wikitech: Analytics/Archive/Data/Pagecounts-all-sites. Use Wikimedia Dumps to download two files of hourly log data for all Wikimedia projects. The filename of each log file is in the format pageviews-yyyymmdd-hh0000. The format for each log file is:
    domain_code page_title count_views total_response_size
Wikiversity's domain_code is en.v. Sample data files are available at Sample Data 1 and Sample Data 2. Write a program that reads all pageview log files in the current directory and uses RegEx groups to parse the data. For en.v records only, create a dictionary using page_title as the key and the sum of count_views as the value.
3. After reading all files and summing count_views, display the top 100 pages and corresponding count_views sorted in descending order by count_views, and alphabetically in the case of a tie.
4. The format for a page_title is Title[/Subpage...]. The title without subpages may be considered the overall learning project. Iterate over the dictionary and use RegEx to separate titles from subpages. Create a separate dictionary with a key for for each learning project and the sum of the page and its subpage count_views as the value. Display the top 100 learning projects and corresponding count_views sorted in descending order by count_views, and alphabetically in the case of a tie.
5. For each of the above, use separate functions for each type of processing. Reuse functions where possible, such as in sorting and searching. Avoid using global variables by passing parameters and returning results. Include appropriate data validation and parameter validation. Add program and function documentation, consistent with the documentation standards for your selected programming language.
