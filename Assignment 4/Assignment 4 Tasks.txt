1. Extend the BMI program from the previous lesson. Rather than terminating the program on invalid input, display an error message and ask the user to enter valid input. Provide a way for the user to terminate the program instead if they choose.

2. Extend the BMI program above. Add a loop to the main program that continues asking for input after displaying each BMI result. Provide a way for the user to terminate the program instead if they choose.

3. Update program and function documentation, consistent with the documentation standards for your selected programming language.

4. Extend the BMI program to displays a BMI table, with columns for height from 58 inches to 76 inches in 2-inch increments and rows for weight from 100 pounds to 250 pounds in 10-pound increments. Reuse the conversion/calculation functions from the BMI program above. Include appropriate program and function documentation, consistent with the documentation standards for your selected programming language.
